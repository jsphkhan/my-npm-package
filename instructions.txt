My simple NPM package that I created to publish on NPM registry

This is a public NPM package - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsphkhan/my-npm-package

This is a scoped package - means I have scoped it to my NPM username to prevent conflicts
Eg. somebody else might have already published a package with same name.

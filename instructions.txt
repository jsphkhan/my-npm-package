My simple NPM package that I created to publish on NPM registry

This is a public NPM package - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsphkhan/my-npm-package

This is a scoped package - means I have scoped it to my NPM username to prevent conflicts
Eg. somebody else might have already published a package with same name.


Publish a scoped public package
----------------------------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages

npm init --scope=@my-username -> Sets up package.json
npm publish --access public -> for first time
npm publish -> next time onwards


Unpublish a public page:
---------------------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry

npm unpublish <package-name> -f


Versioning & Pushing to Github
--------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning
https://tailordev.fr/blog/2018/03/15/automated-npm-releases-with-travis-ci/

npm version 1.1.0
or
npm version minor, npm version major, npm version patch
or npm version patch -m “auto comment” -> versioning with comment

This command performs the following tasks:
1. bump (update) the version number in package.json
2. create a new commit
3. create a git tag

Git push your changes to Github and create a release TAG: git push origin master --tag


After that publish it to NPM directly: npm publish
If you are using Travis CI: see .travis.yml file
    Travis listens to Github repo events. Whenever a push or tag is created, it will trigger a build. 
    That build will publish to NPM. 


Tests
---------
I am using JEST -> ./_tests
yarn test

Install JEST as dev dependencies: yarn add --dev jest


Important
-------------
When somebody installs my package, the dev dependencies are not installed for him

Pending
--------
Minify, Unit Test, Babel, & Publish a lib version, use Travis CI

My simple NPM package that I created to publish on NPM registry

This is a public NPM package - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsphkhan/my-npm-package

This is a scoped package - means I have scoped it to my NPM username to prevent conflicts
Eg. somebody else might have already published a package with same name.


Publish a scoped public package
----------------------------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages

npm init --scope=@my-username
npm publish --access public


Unpublish a public page:
---------------------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry

npm unpublish <package-name> -f


Versioning
--------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning

npm version 1.1.0
or
npm version minor, npm version major, npm version patch

This will update the version inside package.json

After that publish it to NPM

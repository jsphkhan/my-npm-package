My simple NPM package that I created to publish on NPM registry

This is a public NPM package - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsphkhan/my-npm-package

This is a scoped package - means I have scoped it to my NPM username to prevent conflicts
Eg. somebody else might have already published a package with same name.


Publish a scoped public package
----------------------------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages

npm init --scope=@my-username -> Sets up package.json
npm publish --access public -> for first time
npm publish -> next time onwards


Unpublish a public page:
---------------------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry

npm unpublish <package-name> -f


Versioning & Pushing to Github
--------------
https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning
https://tailordev.fr/blog/2018/03/15/automated-npm-releases-with-travis-ci/

npm version 1.1.0
or
npm version minor, npm version major, npm version patch
or npm version patch -m “auto comment” -> versioning with comment

This command performs the following tasks:
1. bump (update) the version number in package.json
2. create a new commit
3. create a git tag

Git push your changes to Github and create a release TAG: git push --tag


After that publish it to NPM directly: npm publish
If you are using Travis CI: see .travis.yml file
    Travis listens to Github repo events. Whenever a commit or tag is created, it will trigger a build. 
    Travis will publish to NPM repo only when a Github Tag is generated. 

Travis CI
--------------
We don’t want to deploy to NPM on every single commit. 
Instead we will use the git tag system and only deploy 
when we tag a commit as a new version. That leaves us 
free to push as many commits as we want and travis will 
run the CI against every one of them to make sure that 
the repo builds and the tests pass. However it will only 
trigger a deployment to NPM if a new tag is present on 
the commit and the continuous integration passes.

Sometimes Travis build does not start due to error in travis.yml file:

Tests
---------
I am using JEST -> ./_tests
yarn test

Install JEST as dev dependencies: yarn add --dev jest

Code Coverage:
----------------
I am using JEST for Coverage

yarn coverage

Important
-------------
When somebody installs my package, the dev dependencies are not installed for him

Pending
--------
